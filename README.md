# APCSA Freedom Project
by Jagger D'Ugo

## Context
This is the main page for the Freedom Project Yahia and I have been working on throughout this school year.
Our idea is an rpg, which we created using Unity. We thought this would be an interesting choice, since most of
our classmates were making apps or expansions on existing things, so a game would stand out.

As for Unity, Yahia had suggested we use it early on in our development process. Not only is it a popular coding
language for games, it actually has many similarities with Java, the language we have been learning in our
main APCSA class.

Of course, the whole point of this Freedom Project was for us to learn things on our own, and apply them to
something we wanted to make. This ended up being very interesting, as it helped me develop various skills
over the course of the project.

## Content
As this page is an intro to our project, the links below are for the blog entries I have written, showing the
process Yahia and I had in creating our game. We spent a lot of time making this, and the blogs below show
the evolution of our game from an idea to something completely playable.

In addition, the blogs have useful links and some pictures for those interested in learning more about Unity/C#,
as well as the differences between C# and Java.
