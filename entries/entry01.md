# Entry 1
##### 10/18/19

#### Background
    My name is Jagger, and I'm a senior taking APCSA. In this class, we've been given the task to
    create a project of our own design, using any coding language of our choosing. Automatically,
    the thought of creating a game entered my mind. Luckily, my friend Yahia had a similar idea, and
    so naturally, we decided to work together. This isn't our only idea, so the project may change
    in the future, but we're really excited to see what we can do.

#### Where Are We Going?
As of now, Yahia and I are thinking about making an rpg, or a role-playing game. These games are not only
really fun and interesting, but they're relatively achievable to make. To do this, we're considering using
__Unity__, as it is a widely available coding language that has a variety of tools which help to make games.
~~Plus, it's free, so if we change our ideas in the future, or wish to use a different language, we won't feel~~
~~as bad.~~

###### In general, things are still very much up in the air at this point, but Yahia and I are interested in not only what we'll be making, but how it will change as we learn about Unity and other languages going forward.

That's all for today, but I'll be back next week for an update. **_See you then!_**
