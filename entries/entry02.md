Hey everyone!

#### A Quick Update
So, after what was __definitely__ a week of exploration, tinkering, and evaluation, I'm back to tell you all about what
I've discovered. First of all, Yahia and I spent a lot of time downloading games and figuring out how they work.
Games with command menues and the ability to map controls were very helpful in this process. In fact, if
anyone is interested, the website we used to find games will be linked at the bottom of the page. Regardless,
Yahia and I also realized that if we wanted to make something with Unity, we would need to learn __C#__. More on
that below.

#### The New Language
C# is an object oriented language that is built similarly to other "C style" languages; those being: C, C++, and
most interestingly, Java! Because we're currently learning Java in our APCSA class, Yahia and I have a head
start in learning C#, and the similarities, at least initially, are striking. Should you be curious, the W3Schools
page on each will be at the bottom of the page. It's really reassuring to see that the language we're about to
learn isn't toally alien, and that makes us both really hopeful that we can speed through the learning to focus
more on the creation of our game. Obviously, we are still going to have to learn as we go, but we're looking
forward to it!

#### Where Are We Going?
After seeing the similarities between C# and Java, Yahia and I have also learned that there are __very__ important
differences between them, especially how function oriented C# is. With that, Yahia and I are going to start really
diving into how we can use what we know to research what we don't, and tinker to see what we can make right
now. Before we do any of that, though, we need to figure out how to excecute C# files in our terminal!

##### About Those Links...

For those looking to see how similar C# is to Java, here are the two languages' pages on W3Schools:

That's all for today, so I'll see you with an update next ~~week~~ time!
