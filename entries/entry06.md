# Entry 6
##### 6/1/20

Hello again, everyone!

#### A Quick Recap
Yahia and I have been working at our Unity rpg idea, even with obstacles like the quarantine, and AP tests. By this
point, we've completed our MVP (minimum viable product), and have been adding extra things to help make
our game that much more enjoyable.

As always, links to C# on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_intro.asp) and [Unity's website](https://unity.com/) are here for those interested.

#### Our Process
As mentioned above, Yahia and I have been in the final stages of our game for the past few weeks, and have
been putting the finishing touches on our game. By rapidly testing and improving our game, we're at a place
that we're satisfied with (though that hasn't stopped us from adding in extra features, like sprites).

As of now, we're also communicating our results, since we are technically done with the Freedom Project itself
(again, we __may__ add more to it later, if time permits). For now, let's get into it!

#### What We've Learned
For the most part, knowledge we've used in the past really shined for us here; Both in terms of C#/Java
knowledge helping with actual coding, and knowledge of Github allowing us to create a respository for us to
keep our game's files stored in one place. Of course, the movement of files was something that quickly became
vital to our whole operation, as we used spritesheets to give us our game's enemies, as well as the player
character.

#### How We're Improving
As we near the end of our Freedom Project, looking back on the skills Yahia and I have developed shows just
how far we've come. Besides, you know, making an rpg in a coding launguage neither of us knew before we
started, skills such as collaboration, organization, and attention to detail showed just how important they are to
making a competent, playable game.

Collaboration was probably most important, as Yahia and I were working together to make this project. To
accomplish this, Yahia and I split up responsabilities on the game, which allowed us to tackle it more efficiently.
##### Thanks again, Yahia. You totally took charge in making sure our project stayed on track and took care of plenty of difficult tasks I would've been unable to do alone. You're the best, man.

Organization is something that came up multiple times throughout or process, especially when it came to
transfering files to tone another. Thankfully, with the combination of the gDocs I created and Yahias numerous
additions to Github, we managed to streamline our process into something way more manageable.

Of course, attention to detail was a major factor in how well our project turned out. I still remember Yahia calling
me up one day to show me the new additions he'd made to the game. We started doing all sorts of things, like
seeing how the character would move around certain objects, and seeing when and where sprites would spawn
on the screen. Seeing that some of the things that we could do, or the places sprites could spawn were a little
strange opened our eyes to changes we needed to make, and it helped get our game looking that much better
because of it.

#### Next Steps
To be completely honest, it feels strange knowing that we don't have to continue actually working on our project
itself anymore. We have a couple more ideas we'll try to implement if we can (music anyone?), but for now,
Yahia and I are going to be working on presentations for our project, and seeing what some of our favorite parts
will be to show off.

Until then, stay well, and stay safe!
